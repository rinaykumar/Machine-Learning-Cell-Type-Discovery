# Random Forest Experiment
## Random Forest Machine Learning applied to single cell transcriptomics for cell type discovery

## Training Database
The training data for this experiment was obtained from J. Craig Venter’s ‘e1 positive.csv’ data sheet, consisting of data related to “Cell type discovery using single cell transcriptomics: implications for ontological representation” by Aevermann B. et al, published in Molecular Genetics 27(R1): R40-R47 · March 2018.

Each column represents gene information with numerical values, with the last column representing a classification label of either positive (1) or negative (0). The data was uploaded into Jupyter Notebook and was first checked to see if the total number of rows and columns were equal with the e1 positive.csv file.
